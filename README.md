# Better-MySQL- Home

_Better-mysql_ is a NodeJS package. With this package you can communicate with a MySQL database with simple code. You can even use _better-MySQL_ without knowing SQL!

## How does it work?

When using this package, you can use multiple functions with data in it. Then, the package convert your simple line of code to SQL, and then request that at the MySQL server!

## Chances ahead

Better-MySQL will get more futures later. Some things are:

* Support for queues.
* Backuping your databases or tables.
* Support for extensions in the package.
* Convert to SQL only.
* Running a MySQL server server with this package.
* Using local SQLITE databases.
* **And many more!**

## Dark mode

Because gitbook doesn't support a dark mode, you have to see everything bright. But, there is a extensions called `dark reader`. If you use that extensions, everything is perfect dark! View [the website](https://darkreader.org/) to know how you can install it \(for `google chrome`, `firefox`and `safari`\).
