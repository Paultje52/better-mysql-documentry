# Using tables

A MySQL database is constructed from tables. You can make, load, chance and delete tables, normally as many as you like!

If you want to work with tables, you have to load in a database. You can find more explanation for this at the [base &gt; Selecting a database](basis.md#selecting-a-database).

## Making a table

To make a table, use the `database.createTable` function.
